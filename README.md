# 📊 From Tweets to Trends: Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning

## 🌟 Overview
This project explores the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to classify sentiments expressed in Twitter data as positive, negative, or neutral. The Sentiment140 dataset, containing 1.6 million labeled tweets, was utilized for model training and evaluation.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Advanced Preprocessing**: Noise removal, tokenization, lemmatization, and feature extraction using TF-IDF.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Comparison of Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for sentiment classification.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

## 🛠️ Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenization and lemmatization.
   - Removal of noise, including URLs, special characters, and stopwords.
   - Class imbalance handled with SMOTE.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - TF-IDF to represent text numerically.
   - Extraction of meaningful insights for sentiment classification.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Multiple algorithms trained to classify sentiments.
   - Visualization of performance through metrics and plots.

## 📈 Results
- **Best Model**: Logistic Regression with 78% accuracy, followed by MLP with 76%.
- **Challenges**: Handling sarcasm, ambiguous text, and class imbalance.

## 🔧 Tools and Technologies
- Python: `scikit-learn`, `NLTK`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`
- Dataset: Sentiment140

## 🌍 Real-World Applications
- **Brand Management**: Track public perception of products or services.
- **Market Analysis**: Gain insights into public opinion trends.
- **Customer Feedback**: Automate sentiment tracking for customer satisfaction.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Incorporate advanced NLP models like BERT or LSTM for context-aware sentiment analysis.
- Explore deep learning for improved accuracy.
